Welcome to my development portfolio, showcasing my transition from Python to JavaScript and React Native. This repository contains projects built as part of my path to create cross-platform mobile apps.

## About
This repository is a collection of projects demonstrating my skills in JavaScript, Node.js, and React Native. I‚Äôm following a structured learning path to build real-world applications, with a focus on clean code, CI/CD, and professional documentation. Tools used:
- **VS Code** with GitLens for development and Git integration.
- **GitHub** for version control and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- **Node.js**.
- **React Native** and **Firebase**.

## Setup
Each project has its own setup instructions in its respective `README.md`. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder to get started:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/olek-scau/react-native-dev.git
cd react-native-dev/<project-folder>
```
