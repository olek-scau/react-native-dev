Welcome to my development portfolio, showcasing my transition from Python to JavaScript and React Native. This repository contains projects built as part of my path to create cross-platform mobile apps using modern tools and best practices.

## About
This repository is a collection of projects demonstrating my skills in JavaScript, Node.js, and React Native. Iâ€™m following a structured learning path to build real-world applications, with a focus on clean code, CI/CD, and professional documentation. Tools used:
- **VS Code** with GitLens for development and Git integration.
- **GitHub** for version control and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- **Node.js** for CLI apps (current phase).
- **React Native** and **Firebase** for upcoming mobile apps.

## Projects
### Todo CLI
- **Description**: A command-line to-do list app built with Node.js and JavaScript.
- **Features**: Add, list, mark, and remove tasks, stored in a JSON file.
- **CI Status**: [![Run Tests](https://github.com/olek-scau/react-native-dev/workflows/Run%20Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/olek-scau/react-native-dev/actions/workflows/test.yml)
- **Location**: [todo-cli/](todo-cli/)
- **Data Storage**: Tasks are stored in `tasks.json`, committed to GitHub.

*More projects (e.g., React Native note-taking app, e-commerce app) will be added as I progress through my learning path.*

## Setup
To explore or run the projects:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/react-native-dev.git
   ```

2. Navigate to a project folder:
   ```bash
   cd todo-cli
   npm install
   node index.js
   ```

3. Run tests
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Data Storage
- **Current**: The todo-cli project stores data in tasks.json, version-controlled in GitHub.
- **Future**: Upcoming React Native projects will use AsyncStorage for local storage and Firebase Firestore for cloud storage.
